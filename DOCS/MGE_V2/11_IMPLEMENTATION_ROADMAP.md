```

---

## Budget Estimate

```yaml
Development Costs (22 weeks):
  Engineers: 4 × $150k/year × 22/52 = $254k
  Infrastructure: $5k (databases, LLM API testing)
  Total: ~$260k

Operational Costs (per month after launch):
  LLM API: $10k-50k (depends on usage)
  Infrastructure: $2k-5k
  Total: $12k-55k/month

Break-even Analysis:
  If 100 projects/month at $200/project = $20k revenue
  Need operational costs <$20k
  Achievable at moderate scale ✅
```
