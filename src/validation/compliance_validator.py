Compliance Validator - Semantic validation of generated code against spec

Compares spec requirements vs generated code to calculate compliance score.
Part of Task Group 4.1: Semantic Validation System.

Validates:
- Entity compliance: entities_found / entities_expected
- Endpoint compliance: endpoints_found / endpoints_expected
- Business logic compliance: validations_found / validations_expected
- Overall compliance: average of all categories

Threshold: FAIL if overall < 0.80 (80%)
