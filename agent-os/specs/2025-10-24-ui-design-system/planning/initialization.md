# Initial Idea: UI Design System for DevMatrix

## User's Original Request

Create a reusable glassmorphism design system component library for DevMatrix UI unification.

## Context

The user wants to apply the look & feel from the MasterplansPage throughout the ENTIRE DevMatrix UI application. This requires creating reusable design system components that implement the glassmorphism aesthetic with:

- Dark gradient backgrounds
- Backdrop blur effects
- Purple accent colors
- Smooth transitions
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Source Material

The design patterns are defined in: `agent-os/workflows/ui-unification-design.md`

Reference implementation: `src/ui/src/pages/MasterplansPage.tsx` and `src/ui/src/components/masterplans/MasterplansList.tsx`

## Goal

Phase 1 of a larger UI unification project. Create 8 foundational design system components:

1. GlassCard
2. GlassButton
3. GlassInput
4. StatusBadge
5. PageHeader
6. SectionHeader
7. SearchBar
8. FilterButton

These components will be used across 15+ pages to achieve visual consistency.
