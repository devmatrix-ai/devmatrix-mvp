# Phase 6: Authentication & Multi-tenancy

## Raw Feature Description

Implement user authentication and multi-tenancy system for DevMatrix to support multiple users with isolated workspaces. This phase includes:

- User registration and authentication (email/password)
- Workspace isolation per user (each user gets their own isolated workspace)
- Usage tracking and quotas (track token usage, API calls, storage per user)
- API key management (users can generate and manage their own API keys)
- Session management (persistent sessions with JWT tokens)
- Role-based permissions (basic roles: user, admin)

This is a foundational feature for DevMatrix to transition from single-user to multi-user SaaS platform.
