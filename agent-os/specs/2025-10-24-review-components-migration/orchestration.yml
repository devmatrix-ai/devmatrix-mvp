    suggested_subagent: frontend-architect
    claude_code_subagent: frontend-architect
    why: "Specialized in creating accessible, performant UI components. Successfully created 8 design system components and 5 review components in previous phases."
    deliverables:
      - "CustomAlert component with 4 severity types"
      - "CustomAccordion component with expand/collapse"
      - "GlassInput enhanced with multiline support"

  - name: Migrate ConfidenceIndicator and ReviewActions
    description: Migrate 2 simpler components from Material-UI to design system
    tasks_file: tasks.md
    section: "Task Group 2"
    estimated_time: "2-3 hours"
    dependencies: ["Task Group 1"]
    suggested_subagent: frontend-architect
    claude_code_subagent: frontend-architect
    why: "Best suited for component migration work, ensuring visual consistency and functionality preservation."
    deliverables:
      - "ConfidenceIndicator migrated (zero Material-UI)"
      - "ReviewActions migrated (zero Material-UI)"
      - "All 4 review actions working (approve, reject, edit, regenerate)"
      - "3 dialogs migrated to custom modals"
      - "2-8 focused tests passing"

  - name: Migrate AISuggestionsPanel and CodeDiffViewer
    description: Migrate 2 complex components from Material-UI to design system
    tasks_file: tasks.md
    section: "Task Group 3"
    estimated_time: "2-3 hours"
    dependencies: ["Task Group 1", "Task Group 2"]
    suggested_subagent: frontend-architect
    claude_code_subagent: frontend-architect
    why: "Experience with complex component migrations and Monaco Editor integration from Phase 2a CodeDiffViewer work."
    deliverables:
      - "AISuggestionsPanel migrated (zero Material-UI)"
      - "CodeDiffViewer migrated (zero Material-UI)"
      - "Monaco Editor preserved (user requirement)"
      - "All accordions, tabs, and lists working"
      - "2-8 focused tests passing"

  - name: QA, Integration Testing, and Documentation
    description: Testing, visual QA, build verification, documentation updates
    tasks_file: tasks.md
    section: "Task Group 4"
    estimated_time: "1-2 hours"
    dependencies: ["Task Group 1", "Task Group 2", "Task Group 3"]
    suggested_subagent: quality-engineer
    claude_code_subagent: quality-engineer
    why: "Specialized in comprehensive testing strategies and systematic validation. Successfully validated Phase 1 (48 tests) and Phase 2a (32 tests)."
    deliverables:
      - "All review component tests pass (~16-34 tests total)"
      - "Integration testing successful in ReviewModal"
      - "Visual consistency verified"
      - "Build succeeds with no errors"
      - "Documentation updated with migration patterns"

# Execution Strategy
execution_mode: sequential
reason: "Each task group depends on previous completions (new components needed for migrations, simple migrations needed before complex ones)"

# Quality Gates
quality_gates:
  - gate: "Task Group 1 Complete"
    criteria:
      - "CustomAlert created and tested"
      - "CustomAccordion created and tested"
      - "GlassInput enhanced for multiline"
      - "2-8 component tests passing"
      - "TypeScript compilation passes"

  - gate: "Task Group 2 Complete"
    criteria:
      - "ConfidenceIndicator migrated"
      - "ReviewActions migrated"
      - "Zero Material-UI imports in both files"
      - "2-8 migration tests passing"
      - "All dialogs working"

  - gate: "Task Group 3 Complete"
    criteria:
      - "AISuggestionsPanel migrated"
      - "CodeDiffViewer migrated"
      - "Zero Material-UI imports in both files"
      - "2-8 migration tests passing"
      - "Monaco Editor still works"

  - gate: "Task Group 4 Complete"
    criteria:

      - "Integration testing successful"
      - "Visual QA checklist complete"
      - "Build verification passed"
      - "Documentation updated"
