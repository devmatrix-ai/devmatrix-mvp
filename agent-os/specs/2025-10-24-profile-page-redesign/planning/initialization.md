# Phase 4: Profile Page Glassmorphism Redesign - Initialization

## Goal
Migrate the Profile Page to glassmorphism design system, achieving 100% visual consistency with MasterplansPage, ReviewQueue, and Admin Dashboard.

## Scope
- **File**: `src/ui/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` (270 lines)
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Material-UI**: None (already clean with Tailwind CSS)
- **Elements to migrate**: ~20-25 replacements

## Current State Analysis
- 100% Tailwind CSS (no Material-UI to remove)
- 2 main card sections (Account Info + Usage Stats)
- 4 metric cards with progress bars
- 1 verified badge
- Loading and empty states
- No modals or complex interactions

## Target Design
Apply glassmorphism to:
1. Account Information card
2. Usage Statistics cards (4 metrics)
3. Progress bars (glassmorphic indicators)
4. Verified badge (glassmorphic badge)
5. Loading state (glassmorphic spinner)
6. Background gradient

## Main Tasks
1. Add gradient background
2. Migrate Account Information card to GlassCard
3. Migrate 4 metric cards to glassmorphic design
4. Create glassmorphic progress bars
5. Update verified badge to glassmorphic style
6. Update loading/empty states

## Success Criteria
- 100% visual consistency with other migrated pages
- All functionality preserved (usage data, formatting)
- No TypeScript errors
- Build succeeds
- Responsive design maintained
