name: Global Coding Style
description: Write clean, consistent, maintainable code following established naming conventions, formatting standards, and the DRY principle across all files in the codebase. Use this skill when writing or refactoring any code file regardless of language or framework to ensure consistent style. Use this skill when naming variables, functions, classes, and files, when formatting code with proper indentation, when creating small focused functions, or when removing dead code and unused imports. Use this skill for Python files, JavaScript/TypeScript files, CSS files, configuration files, or any programming language file. Use this skill when establishing code formatting standards with tools like Prettier, ESLint, Black, or RuboCop, or when applying the DRY principle to eliminate code duplication.

# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing or editing any code file in the project (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, etc.)
- When establishing or following naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files
- When formatting code with consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) and line breaks
- When creating functions and keeping them small, focused, and single-purpose
- When choosing meaningful, descriptive names that reveal intent and avoid abbreviations
- When removing unused code, commented-out blocks, or unnecessary imports
- When refactoring to eliminate code duplication following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- When configuring or using automated formatting tools like Prettier, ESLint, Black, or RuboCop
- When deciding whether backward compatibility logic is needed (default: assume not needed unless specified)
