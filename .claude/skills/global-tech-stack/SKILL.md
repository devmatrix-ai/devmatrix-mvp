- When working with framework-specific patterns (React, Vue, Django, Rails, etc.)
- When adding new dependencies to package.json, requirements.txt, or similar files
- When configuring build tools, CI/CD pipelines, or deployment infrastructure
- When documenting technical decisions or architectural choices
- When ensuring consistency with the project's established technology stack
- When writing code that interacts with third-party services (authentication, email, monitoring)
- When onboarding new team members and explaining the project's technical architecture
- When creating or updating technical documentation about stack choices
