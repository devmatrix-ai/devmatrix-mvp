name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following industry best practices for resource naming, HTTP methods, status codes, and versioning. Use this skill when creating or modifying API route handlers, endpoint files, controller files, or API router configuration files. Use this skill when working with REST API design, implementing HTTP endpoints in backend frameworks, defining API routes and URL patterns, setting up API versioning strategies, or configuring request/response handling in web services. Use this skill when working with files in routes/, api/, controllers/, endpoints/, or views/ directories that handle HTTP requests. Use this skill when defining OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, implementing rate limiting, or establishing API conventions for your application.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or editing API endpoint files (e.g., `routes/*.py`, `controllers/*.js`, `api/*.ts`)
- When designing REST API resource URLs and HTTP method implementations
- When implementing API versioning strategies in your backend application
- When configuring route handlers, request validation, or response formatting in web frameworks
- When working with FastAPI, Express, Django REST Framework, Flask, Rails, or similar backend frameworks
- When defining API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger) or API documentation
- When implementing rate limiting, pagination, filtering, or sorting in API endpoints
- When establishing naming conventions and HTTP status code standards for your API
