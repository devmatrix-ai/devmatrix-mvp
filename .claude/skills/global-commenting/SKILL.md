name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with clear structure and naming, adding minimal concise comments only to explain complex logic sections, avoiding temporal comments about changes or fixes. Use this skill when writing code in any file across the codebase to ensure proper commenting practices. Use this skill when deciding whether to add comments to functions, classes, or complex algorithms, when reviewing existing comments for relevance and evergreen quality, or when refactoring code to be more self-explanatory. Use this skill for Python files, JavaScript/TypeScript files, or any programming language where code documentation is needed. Use this skill when establishing documentation standards, avoiding over-commenting, or removing outdated temporal comments about recent changes.
