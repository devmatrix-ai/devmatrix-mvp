name: Backend Queries
description: Write efficient and secure database queries using parameterized statements, preventing SQL injection, and optimizing performance through proper indexing and eager loading. Use this skill when writing database queries, ORM query methods, SQL statements, or repository pattern implementations. Use this skill when optimizing query performance, preventing N+1 query problems, implementing transactions for data consistency, or adding query timeouts and caching strategies. Use this skill when working with SELECT statements, JOIN operations, WHERE clauses, or any code that interacts with the database to fetch or manipulate data. Use this skill when working with files in repositories/, queries/, services/, or data access layers that contain database query logic.

# Backend Queries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing or optimizing database queries in service files, repositories, or data access layers
- When implementing ORM query methods (e.g., SQLAlchemy queries, Django QuerySets, Prisma queries)
- When writing raw SQL queries or stored procedure calls
- When preventing N+1 query problems through eager loading or joins
- When implementing query optimization strategies (selecting specific columns, adding indexes)
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions for data integrity
- When implementing query caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- When adding query timeouts to prevent runaway queries from affecting performance
- When securing queries against SQL injection through parameterized statements
