name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive input validation on both client and server sides, using allowlists over blocklists, sanitizing user input, and providing specific error messages to prevent security vulnerabilities. Use this skill when writing validation logic for forms, API endpoints, function parameters, or any user input. Use this skill when implementing server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security, adding client-side validation for immediate user feedback, or sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks. Use this skill when working with form components, API route handlers, data processing functions, or validation schemas. Use this skill when defining validation rules for data types, formats, ranges, required fields, or business logic constraints across all application entry points.

# Global Validation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.

## When to use this skill:

- When implementing validation for user input in forms, API endpoints, or function parameters
- When adding server-side validation to ensure security and data integrity
- When implementing client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- When writing validation schemas with libraries like Zod, Yup, Joi, or Pydantic
- When sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and command injection attacks
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields systematically
- When defining business rule validation (e.g., date constraints, balance checks)
- When using allowlists to define acceptable input rather than blocklists
- When providing clear, field-specific error messages to help users correct their input
- When ensuring validation is applied consistently across web forms, API endpoints, and background jobs
