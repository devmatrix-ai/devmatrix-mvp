# Frontend Components

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or editing component files (e.g., `components/*.tsx`, `components/*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`)
- When designing reusable UI components with configurable props and sensible defaults
- When implementing component composition by combining smaller components into larger ones
- When managing component state and deciding between local state and lifted state
- When defining component interfaces with TypeScript, PropTypes, or similar type systems
- When refactoring monolithic components into smaller, single-responsibility pieces
- When creating button components, form inputs, cards, modals, or other UI patterns
- When establishing component naming conventions and organizational structure
- When documenting component usage, props, and providing usage examples
